# System Design Standard â€“ Approved by a 30-Year System Administrator

## **Objective**  
Establish a rigorous, minimalistic, and security-focused system design standard that ensures high availability, maintainability, and efficiency while reducing complexity and unnecessary token cost.

---

## **1. Core Design Principles**  
- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Remove unnecessary services, restrict execution environments, and apply default-deny policies.  
- **Least Privilege & Role Segregation**: Users, processes, and services operate with the minimum required permissions.  
- **Immutable & Reproducible Builds**: System states must be verifiable, and deployments should follow Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).  
- **Automated Compliance & Monitoring**: Continuous security assessments, logging, and automated remediation of vulnerabilities.  
- **Ephemeral & Scoped Authentication**: Favor short-lived tokens, single-use credentials, and least-scope access delegation.  
- **Performance-Efficient Design**: Optimize resource allocation to minimize unnecessary compute, storage, and I/O operations.

## **2. System Build Standards**
| **Category** | **Standard** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **OS & Base Image** | Minimal footprint, hardened images, latest security patches. |
| **Authentication** | Ephemeral, scoped tokens; remove long-lived secrets. |
| **Credential Management** | API keys must be stored securely in .env files excluded from version control. Setup scripts must preserve existing credentials. |
| **Environment Variables** | Must be validated and sanitized before use. Default values should be provided for non-sensitive configurations. |
| **Access Control** | RBAC or ABAC with least privilege enforcement. |
| **Networking** | Default-deny inbound; principle of least access for outbound. |
| **Data Security** | Encrypt at rest and in transit; enforce strict DLP controls. |
| **Logging & Monitoring** | Centralized, immutable logs with automated anomaly detection. |
| **Automation & Deployment** | Immutable infrastructure, automated provisioning via IaC. Setup scripts must include validation and error recovery mechanisms. |
| **Resilience & Recovery** | Automated backups, self-healing architectures, disaster recovery testing. |

## **3. Risks & Mitigations**
| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
|----------|--------------|
| Excessively restrictive access disrupts operations. | Implement controlled elevation with auditing. |
| Complex token management leads to failures. | Automate lifecycle management with expiration policies. |
| Overhead from logging impacts performance. | Implement tiered logging with efficient storage strategies. |

---

## **Next Steps**  
Define implementation-specific configurations based on the system's architecture and operational needs.
