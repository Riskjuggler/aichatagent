# LLM-Optimized System Design Standard

```
Minimize attack surface (default-deny policies, no unnecessary services).
Strict least privilege (RBAC/ABAC, ephemeral auth).
Secure credential management (env vars, preserved secrets, validation).
Immutable & reproducible infra (IaC, automated provisioning).
Zero-trust security (encrypted data, scoped tokens, logging/monitoring).
Performance-optimized (minimal compute/storage overhead).
Self-healing & resilient (automated backups, disaster recovery).
Error-resistant setup (validation, recovery mechanisms).
```
