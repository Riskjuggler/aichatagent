## Enterprise Solution Design Standards (LLM-Optimized)

### 1. MUST-HAVE (REQUIRED)
🔹 **ARC** (Architecture) → _Scalable, modular, API-first, 12-Factor compliant_  
🔹 **SEC** (Security) → _Zero Trust, RBAC, TLS 1.2+/AES-256, logging + monitoring_  
🔹 **RELIABILITY** → _99.9%+ SLA, resilience (circuit breakers, retries, failovers)_  
🔹 **OBSERVABILITY** → _Structured logs, metrics, tracing (OpenTelemetry)_  
🔹 **TEST** → _Automated unit/integration/security tests in CI/CD_  

---

### 2. NICE-TO-HAVE (COST SENSITIVE, OPTIONAL)
✅ **ARC+** → _Event-driven, DDD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC)_  
✅ **PERF** → _Auto-scaling, optimized storage (SQL/NoSQL), edge processing_  
✅ **SEC+** → _Behavior-based threat detection, blue-green/canary deploys_  

---

### 3. EXCELLENCE (HIGH COST, HIGH VALUE)
🌟 **ADV-ARC** → _Multi-cloud, chaos engineering, hybrid/edge infra_  
🤖 **AI-OPS** → _Self-healing, predictive scaling, real-time compliance enforcement_  
🏆 **ENG-EX** → _90%+ automated test coverage, AI-driven security/code reviews_

### Guidelines
1️⃣ **All solutions must meet "MUST-HAVE" criteria**  
2️⃣ **"NICE-TO-HAVE" applies when cost allows**  
3️⃣ **"EXCELLENCE" reserved for strategic, high-scale projects**  

_This ensures an efficient, scalable, and secure enterprise solution design._
