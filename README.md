# aichatagent
This AI chat agent uses Langchain and enables integration with OpenAI, Cohere, or Anthropic APIs to facilitate a direct chat interface with these LLM services.   Ideally this should bypass all the additional AI agents that are built into these service's chat interfaces and operate at a lower token cost.
